Most of these studies, no matter for or against the hypothesis, relied on decoding the orientation of gratings with fMRI voxel responses. \n\nOrientation tuning is one of the fundemantal mechanisms for sensory neurons in visual cortex. However, the neural mechanism underlying orientation decoding is complicated. Rather than just a reflection of fine-scale sampling of orientation tuned neurons, orientation decoding also relies on complex interactions between the stimulus’s orientation, its bounding aperture, and topographic inhomogeneities across the visual field map. In spite of its importance, it is unknown how WM decoding might be affected by these coarse-scale biases.\nHere, we directly address this gap by testing how aperture biases affect WM decoding, as well as testing how sensory-like are WM codes. We used two types of stimuli with the same orientation but orthogonal aperture biases (radial vs. angular modulator) to test how these aperture biases described during perception may affect WM decoding.\n\nPopulation receptive field mapping, trial design, and stimuli generation schema\n\n\nDecoding results showed aperture bias during the perceptual task, where orientations can be decoded only within the same kind of modulated gratings but can’t be generalized to different types in early visual cortex (V1-V3). However, both within and cross-modulator decoding is successful during the WM task. Moreover, we found that classifiers trained during perception can be used to decode orientation information in WM, but only when the aperture bias is aligned with the orientation of the grating (i.e., radial modulator).\n\nDecoding orientation during WM and perception\n\n\nNext, to reveal the representational formats of WM, we constructed the spatial profile of neural activity within visual field maps. Regardless of aperture biases, WM representations of both modulated gratings were recoded into a single-oriented line that matches the remembered orientation but not the aperture bias.\n\nVisualizing WM and perception of radial and angular modulated oriented gratings\n\n\nFinally, we simulated model outputs of both types of modulated gratings as well as line-like images at angles matching the orientation. The spatial maps based on model responses matched those in the perception task, while the results for line-like images matched the WM task.\n\nModeling and reconstructing spatial maps of perceptual and mnemonic representations in V1\n\n\nIn summary, we found the WM decoding of orientation is immune to the aperture biases that drive decoding during perceptual studies of orientation. Moreover, WM representations are reformatted into efficient abstractions of percepts such that they most closely support memory guided behavior.\nPaper link\n","dateCreated":"2025-08-05T08:00:00+08:00","dateModified":"2025-08-12T06:28:09+08:00","datePublished":"2025-08-05T08:00:00+08:00","description":"Decoding working memory (WM) contents from visual cortex has been widely found in human neuroimaging studies, demonstrating the idea that visual WM storage uses similar encoding mechanism as visual perception in the visual cortex.

<br>

<p>Decoding results showed aperture bias during the perceptual task, where orientations can be decoded only within the same kind of modulated gratings but can’t be generalized to different types in early visual cortex (V1-V3). However, both within and cross-modulator decoding is successful during the WM task. Moreover, we found that classifiers trained during perception can be used to decode orientation information in WM, but only when the aperture bias is aligned with the orientation of the grating (i.e., radial modulator).</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Next, to reveal the representational formats of WM, we constructed the spatial profile of neural activity within visual field maps. Regardless of aperture biases, WM representations of both modulated gratings were recoded into a single-oriented line that matches the remembered orientation but not the aperture bias.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Finally, we simulated model outputs of both types of modulated gratings as well as line-like images at angles matching the orientation. The spatial maps based on model responses matched those in the perception task, while the results for line-like images matched the WM task.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>In summary, we found the WM decoding of orientation is immune to the aperture biases that drive decoding during perceptual studies of orientation. Moreover, WM representations are reformatted into efficient abstractions of percepts such that they most closely support memory guided behavior.</p>
