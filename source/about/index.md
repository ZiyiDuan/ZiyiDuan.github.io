Hi, I am Zoe! My Chinese name is Ziyi Duan(段紫逸), just like a purple bunny in a skateboarding. I am a Ph.D. student in [ClaySpace Lab](https://www.clayspacelab.com/) in the Department of Psychology at New York University. Before that, I worked as a research assistant in [Lewis-Peacock Lab](https://www.lewpealab.org/home) at The University of Texas at Austin, and did my undergraduate and master work with [Dr. Xiaowei Ding](https://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/719) at Sun Yat-sen University (China).


As a cognitive neuroscientist, I am interested in the relationship between **brain-mind-behavior**. In particular, I am interested in the neural and computational mechenisms of **working memory**, a core cognitive function that is essential for flexible behaviors. My research combines psychophysics, eye-tracking, neuroimage (fMRI, EEG), machine learning, and computational modeling. I especially enjoy foraging scientific innovation by designing new experimental approaches and combining up-to-date techniques. Moreover, I hope to contribute to clinical applications in mental and brain disorders. 


If you want to know more about my research, please see **[Research](/research)** and my **[CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k58mSf4gRsOJBmFiCuKN0xaoHC--m2jIXktMbmoVUY0/edit?usp=sharing)**.
