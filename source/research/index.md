# Research Interests
### General areas
>* ⭐ **Topics**: long-term memory, working memory, cognitive control, goal-directed behavior
>* 🔑**Keywords**: cognitive flexibility, adaptive distortion, representational transformation, dynamic interaction, prefrontal circuits, cortico-hippocampal interaction

### Specific Research Questions
>* How do we strategically control what to remember and what to forget?
>* How do the prefrontal circuits interact with the medial temporal lobe/hippocampus?
>* How do we reformat our memory representations to facilitate goal-directed behavior?
>* How does the brain give rise to the representational transformation in terms of different goals?


&nbsp;

# Research Methods
>* 🙋‍♀️ Behavioral experiments: Psychophysics, eye-tracking
>* 💻 Computational modeling: Bayesian modeling, Machine learning
>* 🧠 Neuroscience: EEG, fMRI
