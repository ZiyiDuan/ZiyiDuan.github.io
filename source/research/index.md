# Research Interests
### General areas
>* **Topics**: working memory, attention, perception, decision making
>* **Keywords**: mental/neural representation, goal-directed behavior, dynamic resource allocation, neural network, neural dynamics


### Research Questions
 
>* How do our brains form working memory representations?

What is the nature of WM representation? WM can maintain a stable representation in our mind without sensory input for a short time. Importantly, WM representation can be reformatted in terms of different goals. I am quite interested in how we transform perceptual representations into WM representations and how they change in service of different behavioral goals? How is the goal-directed reformatting implemented in the brain? 

&nbsp;

>* How do we use working memory to guide our behaviors?

WM is well-known for its limited capacity. How do limitations of WM constrain our decisions? How to select and prioritize part of internal representations within WM for optimally guiding behaviors? I am particularly interested in the dynamic resource allocation process. For example, how can we track multiple goals across different times? What is the computational mechanism underlying the dynamic resource allocation? Whether and how can we improve our WM abilities and overcome its constraints?
