In general, I'm interested in the neural and computational bases of forming **internal representations** in human brains to guide goal-directed behaviors. My research focuses on **working memory (WM)**, a cognitive function used to maintain and manipulate information online in service of task goals. Here are some research questions that I am currently pursuing, with links to related projects.


### Goal-directed neural representations
WM is essential for goal-directed behaviors. Compared to sensory inputs, WM formats are more abstract and flexible, allowing them to meet different task demands. My research questions are: How do high-level task demands change neural codes in the brain? How do different brain regions interact to implement these functions? What are the computational basis of representational transformations?

### Neural codes for motor planning
While maintaining the sensory information, the brain needs to transform neural activities from sensory to motor codes in preparation for future action executions. What are the fundamental differences between sensory and motor systems, and how do they interact during motor planning? Currently, my research focuses on planning movements for two modalities: eyes and hands.

### Interactions between different memory systems
WM and long-term memory (LTM) are two separate but connected systems. WM is flexible, but can only maintain a limited amount of information for a brief period. LTM, on the other hand, can store a vast amount of information for a much longer period. I'm interested in questions: How do neural signals of WM predict their fates in LTM? How do learned regularities and prior knowledge affect the current formation of WM representations?
