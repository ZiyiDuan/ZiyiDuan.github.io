In general, I'm interested in the neural and computational bases of generating **internal representations** to guide human natural behaviors. My research focuses on **working memory(WM)**, a cognitive function used to maintain and manipulate information online in service of task goals. Here are some research questions that I am currently pursuing, with links to related projects.


### Goal-directed neural representations
WM is essential for goal-directed behaviors. Even though there are many similarities between WM and sensory codes, WM formats can be more abstract and flexible, allowing them to meet different task demands. How do high-level task demands change neural codes in the brain? How do different brain regions (sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices) interact to implement these functions?

### Neural codes for action planning
While maintaining the sensory information, brains need to transform neural activities from sensory to motor codes in order to execute actions. Do we have a domain-general planning system for different kinds of action planning? What are the fundamental differences between sensory and motor systems and how do they interact during action planning? In particular, my research focus on planning movements for eyes and hands.

### Interactions between WM and LTM
WM and LTM are two separate but connected systems. WM can maintain a limited amount of information for a brief period and is flexible and dynamic, enabling adaptive behaviors. LTM, on the other hand, can store a vast amount of information for a much longer period. I'm interested in two research questions: 1.How do neural signals of WM predict their fates in LTM? 2.How do learned regularities and prior knowledge affect the current formation of WM representations?
