# Research Interests
### General areas
>* **Topics**: Visual perception and working memory, mental imagery, goal-directed behavior, neural representation, neural dynamics

### Research Questions
 
>* How do our brains form working memory representations?

What is the nature of WM representation? WM can maintain mental representations in our mind without sensory input for a short time. Importantly, WM representation can be reformatted in terms of different goals. I am quite interested in how we transform perceptual representations into WM representations and how they change in service of different behavioral goals? How is the goal-directed reformatting implemented in the brain? 

&nbsp;

>* How do brain states change over time?

Do our brains need persistant neural activity to maintain the representaion of WM? Whether the nerual representation of WM is stable or dynamic? How do our brains transform neural activities in preparation of future behaviors? 

&nbsp;

>* How does working memory allocate its limited resources?

WM is well-known for its limited capacity. How does WM avoid interference when facing new sensory inputs? What is the relationship between interference and WM constraints? How do limitations of WM influence our decisions? How to select and prioritize part of internal representations within WM to optimize behaviors?
