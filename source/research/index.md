# Research Interests
### General areas
>* **Topics**: attention, perception, working memory, long-term memory, decision making
>* **Keywords**: neural representation, neural dynamics, distributed neural network, cognitive flexibility, goal-directed behavior


### Research Questions
 
>* How do our brains form working memory representations?

WM can maintain a stable representation in our mind without sensory input for a short time. Importantly, WM representation can be reformatted in terms of different goals. I am quite interested in how we transform perceptual representations into WM representations and how they change in service of behavioral goals? What is the nature of WM representation? How do different brain regions and distributed neural networks contribute to it?


&nbsp;

>* How do our brains track multiple goals within working memory?

With resource constrain, WM can hold limited information online. However, in complex real life, we always have multiple goals to achieve. I am interested in how our brains track multiple goals and prioritize different goals at different time? How can we flexibly control information online and offline? How does WM coordinate different goals and guide our decisions?


&nbsp;

>* How does past experience interact with current working memory?

WM serves as a bridge between past, current, and future. I am interested in how learning impacts the current representations of WM and how neural dynamics during WM shape the formation of lasting memories. How does long-term memory asist WM to guide our current behaviors? How do we coordinate conflicts between WM and long-term memory.
